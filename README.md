# MemeMeApp2.0

**Project Overview**
In MemeMe 1.0 the app enables a user to take a picture, and add text at the top and bottom to form a meme, and share that meme on Facebook and Twitter and also by SMS or email. In this 2.0 version, sent memes will appear in a tab view with two tabs: a table view and a collection view.

**What does it cover?**
MemeMe covers many of the major UI components found in essentially every app. It combines them with the camera and social media activity view to create a fun and personal user experience.

**What did I practice?**
Set up a navigation structure that creates an intuitive flow through the app
Build tables with datasources and delegates
Create custom table view cells
Implement user interfaces with tab views and collection views
